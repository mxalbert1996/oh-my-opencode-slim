# Directory Map: `src/v2/`

## Responsibility

OpenCode v2 (`opencode2`) host adapter. Bridges the existing v1 plugin factory
into v2's promise-plugin transform/runtime-hook API so a single published
package runs on both hosts.

v2 loads `default.setup(ctx)` (v1 loads `default.server`). `setup` wraps the v1
factory to reuse all build logic, then translates the returned v1 `Hooks` into
v2 registrations. v1 behavior is unchanged.

## Entry Points

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | Barrel: re-exports `createV2Setup` and the v2 context types. Imported by `src/index.ts` for the dual `default` export. |
| `setup.ts` | `createV2Setup()` → the `setup(ctx)` orchestrator v2 calls. Capability-guards reduced/TUI-side hosts (no `agent.transform`). Registers agents, tools, MCPs, commands, the merged context hook, the native `session.prompt` bridge, the chat.headers `session.model.request` bridge, the `session.compaction` bridge, tool-execute bridges, and the event pump. Session hooks register **unconditionally** on full v2 contexts: a registration failure fails setup loudly. MCP transform is registered before agent transform; setup never materializes `ctx.agent.list()`. The MCP callback captures host namespaces, then the agent callback finalizes the registry and opens prompt readiness. Deferred callbacks do not fail setup, but an agent callback before the MCP snapshot fails rather than finalizing incomplete policy. Managed prompts fail closed until agent finalization. Missing MCP transform is unsupported and fails setup. Other domain transforms remain independently try/catch-guarded with a zero-registration health check. Child-session permission rules are applied via `ctx.session.update({sessionID, permissions})` (`createPermissionRulesBridge`); missing `session.update` remains an optional degraded child bridge. Exports the pure command-marker helpers (`wrapCommandMarker`, `parseCommandMarker`, `stripCommandMarker`). |
| `types.ts` | v2 plugin context surface (`V2Context` + draft/event types), mirrored locally (v2 plugin package is not a build-time dependency). Runtime-probed session methods (`get`/`interrupt`/`switchModel`/`context`/`prompt`/`synthetic`/`update`/`switchAgent`) and the optional `mcp` domain are declared optional with probe notes. |
| `session-submit.ts` | Shared `createSessionSubmit` (prompt-only user-prompt submit via `ctx.session.prompt`) + `textFromContent`; used by both the generic command bridge and the interview bridge to avoid a setup↔bridge import cycle. |
| `client-shim.ts` | `buildPluginInput`: constructs a v1-shaped `PluginInput` with a **real-delegation** client — v1 SDK call shapes translate to v2 flat session calls (`get`, `interrupt` — abort sends `resume: false`, `context`, `prompt` with `delivery:"steer"`, `update` for renames — `{sessionID, title}`), with honest degradation (log or omit) where the host lacks the method. `resolveV2Directory` prefers `ctx.location.directory` (#45403+) with a `process.cwd()` fallback. `promptAsync` encapsulates the v2 model-switch semantics (`switchModel` before the prompt) and accepts an optional `delivery` argument (default `"steer"` for the foreground-fallback replay; the orchestrator-wake scheduler passes `"queue"` to match v1's queued prompt_async); chat-header metadata is derived internally from the body's internal-initiator parts, not passed by callers. |
| `internal-admissions.ts` | Bounded tracker of internal-initiator admissions (`recordInternalAdmission`/`isInternalAdmission` + `createInternalSyntheticMessageID`): the in-band marker source for the chat-headers bridge on v2 (prompt-metadata admissions recorded by the session-prompt bridge; synthetic admissions recorded by the client shim with the client-chosen id the v2 `Session.synthetic` endpoint honors and preserves on the LLM context message). |
| `delegation.ts` | v2↔v1 delegation tool normalization: `toolNameToV1` (`subagent`→`task`), `subagentArgsToV1` (`agent`→`subagent_type`, `sessionID`→`task_id`), `v1ArgsToSubagent` (reverse). Lets the whole v1 pipeline (task-session-manager, job board, `task_*` tools) run on v2's host `subagent` tool with zero changes. |
| `event-adapter.ts` | `mapV2EventToV1`: additive-only v2→v1 event synthesis for the event pump. Raw event always first (interview bridge consumes it); payload is read from the live wire key `data` (`{id, created, type, location?, durable?, metadata?, data}` — verified live on v2 hosts) with `properties` as the legacy/test fallback, while every synthesized shape writes `properties` (what the v1 consumers read). Syntheses: `session.execution.*` → v1 busy/idle/error lifecycle shapes, flat child `session.created` → v1 early-registration `{info:{id,parentID,agent?}}`, usage telemetry (`session.usage.updated`/`session.step.ended`) → deduplicated completed-assistant `message.updated` (deterministic fingerprint id; no wall-clock/randomness). |
| `mirror-conformance.ts` | Mirror conformance guard (P1.2): type-level verification that the hand-written v2→v1 mirror matches the @opencode/plugin upstream surface exactly. Prevents drift between the v2 contract and the v1 consumption surface. |
| `tui.ts` | v2 TUI plugin entry (`./tui` export → `dist/tui2.js`): re-exports the v1 dual-contract TUI (`../tui`) and extends its v2 `setup` with the `/preset` keymap flow. The layer registers from an `append: "app"` slot render because the host's `keymap.layer` is provider-scoped (calling it from `setup` throws `Keymap.Provider is missing`), using the host's thunk + full command schema (`id`, `palette`, `slash.arguments`); feedback via `ui.toast.show`; persists via `switchPresetOnDisk`; `/preset <name>` fast path. Capability-guarded: hosts without `ui.slot`/`keymap.layer` keep the sidebar and lose only `/preset`; the interactive picker additionally needs `ui.dialog.select`. |
| `adapters.ts` | Shape adapters: `parseModelRef`, `adaptPermissions` (v1 map → v2 Rule[] + v2 permissive base + `task`→`subagent`/`bash`→`execute` mapping), `adaptTool`, `applyAgentToDraft`. |
| `interview-bridge.ts` | v2-only `/interview` marker command, trailing-message context bridge, v2 interview runtime, and per-session transcript projections. |
| `mirror-conformance.ts` | Compile-time conformance guard binding the hand-mirrored v2 context types in `types.ts` to the pinned `@opencode/plugin` surface; enforced by `bun run typecheck` — deliberately no `.test.ts` suffix (tsc excludes test files) and never imported at runtime. |

## Flow

The v2 runtime surface and plugin contracts are adapted through the following data flow:

1. **Capability Detection**: The v2 orchestrator calls `setup(ctx)` which probes optional capabilities like `ctx.generate.text` for one-shot generation and `ctx.location.directory` for directory access.

2. **V1 Plugin Input Construction**: The client shim builds a v1-shaped `PluginInput` using the v2 session surface where it exists (real delegation) with honest degradation where it doesn't. This includes:
   - Translating `subagent` tool calls to v1 `task` semantics
   - Mapping v2 model refs (`{id, providerID}`) to v1 chat.message models (`{providerID, modelID}`)
   - Handling session IDs between `sessionID` ↔ `task_id` mappings
   - Resolving directory paths from `ctx.location` or falling back to `process.cwd()`

3. **V1 Plugin Invocation**: The built `PluginInput` invokes the v1 factory `OhMyOpenCodeLite`, receiving v1 `Hooks` that encapsulate all the build logic and subsystem wiring.

4. **V2 Domain Registrations**: The setup translates v1 hooks into v2 domain registrations:

   - **Agent domain**: Uses `applyAgentToDraft` to create v2 agent drafts from v1 agent configs, with the orchestrator agent registered as default
   - **Tool domain**: Uses `adaptTool` to convert v1 tool definitions to v2 JSON schemas via zod shape adaptation
   - **MCP domain**: Uses `adaptMcpServer` to convert v1 McpConfig to v2 Mcp.ServerConfig (fields are nearly identical with minor cleanup)
   - **Command domain**: Uses marker-based round-trip registration where v2 command drafts are add-only, and `execute` submits whole-text-anchored `<omos-cmd-command>` markers as user prompts
   - **Session hooks**: Single `ctx.session.hook("context")` handles system/messages transforms, chat.message agent tracking, and marker dispatch with interview bridge integration
   - **Runtime bridges**: Separate session hooks for `prompt`, `model.request`, and `compaction` bridges that adapt v1 chat.headers, chat.message, and session.compaction to v2
   - **Permission rules**: Uses `createPermissionRulesBridge` to apply child-session permission rules via `ctx.session.update({sessionID, permissions})`
   - **Tool execute bridges**: Uses `createToolExecuteBridges` to normalize `subagent`→`task` semantics for tool.execute.before/after hooks
   - **Event pump**: Uses `mapV2EventToV1` for additive-only v2→v1 event synthesis, preserving raw events for the interview bridge

5. **Initialization and Cleanup**: The setup returns a cleanup function that disposes every v2 registration and the v1 `dispose`.

## Key Decisions

- **No v2 type imports.** The v2 plugin package is not a build-time dependency (v1 host must load the main build). `types.ts` mirrors the consumed subset; optional domains are probed at runtime.
- **Wrap, don't reimplement.** The v1 factory owns all subsystem wiring (agents, hooks, job board, multiplexer, companion); the adapter only translates at the boundary.
- **Real delegation, honest degradation.** The client shim maps v1 SDK calls to the v2 session surface where it exists and explicitly fails/logs where it does not — capability probes (e.g. `session.get` presence) must see the truth, so no method is stubbed with a fake success shape.
- **Subagent normalization at the execute bridge.** v2's host `subagent` tool is translated to v1 `task` semantics in `createToolExecuteBridges` (names + args, both directions), reusing the v1 task pipeline unchanged; before-hook failures rethrow so v2 refuses the call like v1 does.
- **Additive event synthesis.** `mapV2EventToV1` never mutates the raw event; synthesized v1 shapes are appended for the specific fields the v1 consumers read (early registration gated on `parentID`; telemetry deduped by a deterministic fingerprint — no wall-clock or randomness).
- **Permission base.** v1 permission maps list only explicit entries (unlisted → implicit default-allow); v2 has no implicit default, so `adaptPermissions` prepends v2's standard permissive base before overlaying v1 entries.
- **Interview configuration.** `setup` resolves the current plugin config and passes the complete `interview` object to the v2 interview bridge. The bridge uses its `maxQuestions`, `outputFolder`, `autoOpenBrowser`, `port`, and `dashboard` values rather than rebuilding defaults at the boundary.
- **Interview cache boundary.** The interview context hook only rewrites the current trailing command message; prior messages remain unchanged for provider prompt-cache prefix reuse.
- **Commands via marker round-trip.** v2 command drafts are add-only, so `execute` submits a whole-text-anchored `<omos-cmd-command>` marker as a user prompt and the session context hook dispatches it to the v1 `command.execute.before` hook, mutating only the trailing message (same cache-preserving rule as the interview bridge).
- **Capability guard.** Hosts invoking `setup()` with a reduced/TUI-side ctx (no `agent.transform`) are skipped gracefully instead of crashing.
- **Shared session submit.** A single `session-submit.ts` helper submits marker text via `ctx.session.prompt` for both the generic commands and the interview bridge.

## Integration Points

- `src/index.ts`: imports `createV2Setup` for the dual `default` export (`{ id, server, setup }` — no `tui` key; hosts validate that a server module's `tui` field is a function and never coexists with `server`) and exports `OhMyOpenCodeLite` (named) for the adapter to wrap. The `hostFlavor: 'v2'` marker from the shim gates the multiplexer off (`shouldEnableMultiplexer` /
  `sessionManagerMultiplexerConfig`).
- `src/tools/smartfetch/secondary-model.ts`: consumes the `experimental_v2.generateText` channel threaded by `setup` for one-shot summaries; absent channel → secondary-model summaries are unavailable (logged) — the v2 shim has no `session.create`/`tool.ids`, so the v1 session pipeline cannot substitute.
- Build: `build:v2` bundles `src/index.ts` (which pulls in `src/v2/`) into `dist/server/index.js` (self-contained except `jsdom`) — the directory entrypoint 2.x hosts require, also served via the
  `./server` package subpath (the exports map resolves it directly);
  `build:tui` bundles `src/v2/tui.ts` into `dist/tui2.js`.

## Limitations (see `docs/opencode-v2-compatibility.md`)

Multiplexer is v1-only by design (v2 renders subagents natively). The
orchestrator-wake scheduler runs on v2 in children-driven degraded mode
(list+promptAsync gate, `session.list({parentID})` enumeration with the
event-tracked fallback, outcome-based condition with a 3×-interval staleness
bound, `queue` delivery — see `src/hooks/orchestrator-wake/codemap.md`).
Finalized-registry setup captures configured MCP namespace inventory through
`ctx.mcp.transform` before the deferred agent transform callback runs. Setup
does not force host materialization with `ctx.agent.list()`. Until agent
finalization, prompt admission fails closed; a premature agent callback cannot
freeze policies without the host MCP inventory. Hosts without the MCP
transform itself are unsupported and setup fails with an actionable error.
`session.update` remains optional: hosts without it degrade only the PR7 child
permission bridge. Model switching needs
`session.switchModel` ≥ #43718; directory needs `ctx.location` ≥ #45403
(hosts without it fall back to cwd). Companion is
unverified on v2. Prompt-cache safety rules are unchanged
(trailing-message-only mutation).
